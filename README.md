# Seychell

https://seychell.sabinegottfried.de/

Seychell is a small weather information app conceived for a coding challenge as part of a job application.
I had **never used Angular before and learned it for this assignment**. This was my first try at it. For the rest its using **Node.js** and **MongoDB**.

## The Project Brief: 
(5 days completion time)

## Scenario:
We need a system where our users can log in to know the current day (DD MM YYYY) and
display the weather in Seychelles islands, because one day we may just go there to have fun.

## Requirements:
###### 1. Signup page​
Here our users could register in the application. They should be able to enter
their first name, last name, email and password credentials.
###### 2. Login page 
The main page of the app. It should contain a header title and image (up to your
own creativity), and two input fields: one for email and another one for password. Please try to
follow security best practices when storing the password and when entering incorrect
credentials.
###### 3. Welcome page
This is the page where the user is automatically redirected after a successful
login. The screen should contain four different sections:
- Welcome section: a welcome message that should contain the first name and last name
of the user (something like: Welcome back John Brown)
- Day and weather in Seychelles islands: current day and weather in Seychelles. Ideally,
this should be in real time via an API (there are several free APIs online to do it, you can
use Victoria, Seychelles as a reference).
- A picture of Seychelles landscape. It will be a plus if this picture is randomly chosen or if
the user can select between different pictures.
- Logout button: a button to close the session and go back to the login page.
- It is important that the system keeps the session open somehow, so if the user refreshes
this page and the session is still valid, he/she won’t be redirected to the login page
again.
- The session should expire after 5 minutes, so if the user refreshes the page after 5
minutes, he/she should be redirected to the login page.
Again, the layout of this page and the different ways to find your data are totally up to your own
taste and creativity.

## Considerations:
- We propose the usage of MEAN stack​ technologies: MongoDB, Express, Angular and
NodeJS.
- Ideally, your final app should be online​, accessible from any computer. To do so, it
should be deployed and working in a free heroku dyno​. However, we know that this
might be very challenging, so it is ok if you cannot achieve it.
- Your source code must be in a Git repository ​and eventually accessible to us once the
assignment is completed (does not matter what kind of Git: Github, GitLab, Bitbucket,
that’s up to you).
- Good and nice designs of the pages are a plus​. We just provide a small description of
the screens because we want you to use your creativity and surprise us with your ideas,
so feel free to add something if you think that it improves the overall result. You can
make up names, titles, headers, fonts, texts, use whatever you want.
- Please try to follow coding best practices​ as much as possible.
- Do not worry if you cannot do some parts of the assignment, the process is more
important than the result. It would be helpful if you could keep a script with the steps
that you have followed​ (even the wrong ones) and give it to us. With that script we
could see that you have tried hard and the different attempts that you do won’t be in
vain.
- The requirements and the time provided should be enough for you to complete the
assignment and enjoy the process of doing it. However, if you think that you cannot do it
in the requested technologies, you can use another one. Ideally you should use the
MEAN stack and we encourage you to do so, though.
